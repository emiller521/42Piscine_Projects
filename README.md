# 42Piscine_Projects

Many students consider it to be one of the highlights of their student life: everyone around you shares a similar passion for coding and is facing the exact same dilemmas at the same time.


Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come and spend 4 weeks, 7 days a week, day and night, coding your heart out with several hundred other candidates all hoping to earn the same prize: to be a full-time student at 42.


We start with the basics, and using a computer, you will write your first lines of code before moving on to more complex coding exercises.
No previous programming experience required! 
We simply ask that you know how to use a mouse and a keyboard.

Throughout this experience, you will try and you will fail, over and over again.
Thatâ€™s the point: learning the trial-and-error process builds stamina, determination, and process skills that are necessary to be a software engineer.

The Piscine is done using the 42 style of learning: 

  ->NO Teachers

  ->NO Classes 

  ->Project Based Length

  ->NO Books
  
You work by yourself and in groups, ask your peers for help, help your peers, and complete projects.
